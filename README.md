## Repository Operations

All development should be done using the "dev" branch.

Please fork dev, make your changes, then submit a pull request.

After enough of a milestone is met, merges will be made to main.

## Non-JGAAP contributors

Unless your work is good, and its actual code with documentation in the code. Consider your pull request auto-closed with the tenacity of the gravity in a black hole.
